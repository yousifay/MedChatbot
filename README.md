MedChatbot: Your AI-Powered Medical Information Assistant

‚öïÔ∏è Project Overview

MedChatbot is an intelligent conversational AI designed to provide reliable, general information regarding medical conditions, symptoms, and basic health queries. Built using large language models, this tool serves as a preliminary information resource, helping users understand common health topics and directing them toward appropriate next steps (like consulting a professional).

üö® IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: MedChatbot is an informational tool only and is NOT a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always seek the advice of a qualified health provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition.

‚ú® Features
Symptom Analysis: Provides information and potential causes related to described symptoms.

Condition Explanations: Offers clear, concise summaries of various medical conditions and diseases.

Drug Interaction Information: (Future Feature) Basic information on common drug uses and warnings.

Referral Guidance: Advises when and where to seek professional medical attention.

üöÄ Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
Git (for cloning the repository)

Python 3.8+

pip (Python package installer)

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/yousifay/MedChatbot.git](https://github.com/yousifay/MedChatbot.git)
cd MedChatbot

Set up a virtual environment (Recommended for local dev):

# For Unix/macOS
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
# For Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt 
# (Assuming you have a file named requirements.txt with necessary libraries like Flask, gradio, requests, etc.)

Configure API Key (Hugging Face Spaces):

The chatbot requires an API key for the underlying language model (e.g., Google's Gemini API key).

If deploying to Hugging Face Spaces:

Go to your Space settings.

Navigate to Secrets and add a new secret.

Set the Name as GEMINI_API_KEY.

Set the Value to your actual API key.

The Space environment will automatically make this key available to your application.

If running locally:

Create a file named .env in the root directory and add your key:

# .env file
GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"

Run the application:

Local Development:

python app.py 
# (If your main file is called app.py)

Hugging Face Spaces:
The Space automatically detects and runs the application based on the files present (e.g., app.py, app.gradio, or requirements.txt for Streamlit/Gradio). Ensure your main execution file is named appropriately for the Space environment.

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
Core AI: Google Gemini (via API) for conversational logic and medical grounding.

Backend: Python (Flask/Django/FastAPI / Gradio or Streamlit for Spaces deployment)

Frontend: HTML/CSS/JavaScript (or React/Vue, etc.)

Package Management: pip / requirements.txt
